Since this is a simple task that doesn't require any specific tools, I'll provide a direct response.\n\n**Response:**\n\nThank you for the test message. I acknowledge receipt and confirm that I'm operational and ready to assist with your tasks.

    "global_summary": "The AI is receiving and acknowledging a series of sub-agent reports regarding a system test. The sub-agent completed Task 1 (analyzing a test message) and Task 3 (verifying system components), both with timeouts. For Task 2, the sub-agent generated and summarized a response acknowledging the test message and confirming operational readiness. For Task 4, the sub-agent delivered a detailed system readiness confirmation, reporting stable metrics, normal function of all critical components, and noting that the system is fully operational.",
