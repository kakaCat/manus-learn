    "global_summary": "The AI receives and acknowledges a series of sub-agent reports. The first three reports confirm the completion of initial analysis and response tasks. The fourth report delivers a comprehensive system readiness confirmation, detailing that all systems are operational and ready. The report includes healthy metrics for uptime, memory, disk space, processes, and system load, concluding the system is stable and fully functional. The AI acknowledges this final report.",
